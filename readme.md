# Tippi Fifestarr's Dynamic HTML Resume

This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for Tippi Fifestarr's professional resume, designed to showcase his skills and experience as a Technical Writer and Developer Relations professional in the Web3 space.

## Overview

The `index.html` file in this repository is a self-contained HTML document that includes both the structure (HTML) and styling (CSS) of the resume. This approach allows for easy deployment and sharing of the resume as a single file.  Easily adaptable for specific roles and modifiable by AI assistants.

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The resume is designed to be responsive, with a maximum width of 800px and centered on the page. This ensures readability across various device sizes.

2. **Custom Styling**: The CSS is embedded in the `<style>` tag within the HTML file, providing a clean and professional look with carefully chosen colors and formatting.

3. **Structured Layout**: The resume is divided into clear sections including a header, professional summary, skills and education, professional experience, and key achievements.

4. **Interactive Elements**: Skills and certifications are displayed as interactive-looking tags, enhancing visual appeal and scannability.

5. **Achievements Highlight**: Key achievements are marked with a star symbol (â˜…) to draw attention to important accomplishments.

## Technical Details

### HTML Structure

The HTML uses semantic tags to organize content:

- `<header>`: Contains the name and contact information
- `<section>`: Used to separate different parts of the resume
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`: Used for hierarchical headings
- `<ul>` and `<li>`: Used for listing experiences and achievements

### CSS Highlights

1. **Flexbox**: Used for layout in the contact info and skills/education sections
2. **Custom Classes**: `.skill`, `.certification`, `.achievement` for styled list items
3. **Pseudo-elements**: Used to add the star symbol before achievements
4. **Color Scheme**: A professional color palette using hex codes (e.g., #2c3e50, #34495e)
5. **Typography**: Arial font with fallback to sans-serif, varying font sizes for hierarchy
